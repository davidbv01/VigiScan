# AI-Powered Image Processing & RamDisk Cleaner

Welcome to this repository, where AI meets optimization! üöÄ This project integrates two powerful modules:

1. **YOLO Object Detection**: An AI-powered image processing module that detects objects using YOLO_V8, draws bounding boxes around detected items, and saves the images for further analysis.
   
2. **RamDisk Cleaner**: A utility that keeps your system running smoothly by automatically cleaning old files from your RamDisk (or any specified directories) based on an age threshold.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository consists of two key components:

### 1. **Image Processing with YOLO (You Only Look Once)**

- This module utilizes a pre-trained YOLO_V8 model to perform real-time object detection in images. It automatically draws bounding boxes around detected objects and saves the processed images with unique filenames based on the timestamp.
  
  #### Key Functions:
  - **`Process(cv::Mat& frame, int cameraID)`**: This function processes an image, performs object detection using the YOLO_V8 model, and draws bounding boxes on detected objects.
  - **`saveImage(const cv::Mat& image)`**: Saves the processed image to a specified directory with a unique filename that includes the current timestamp.
  - **`ReadCocoYaml(YOLO_V8*& p)`**: Reads a YAML file containing the class names that the YOLO model should recognize.

### 2. **RamDisk Cleaner**

- This module helps you optimize your storage by cleaning old files from a RamDisk or specified directories based on a configurable age limit. It runs in the background and ensures your system doesn‚Äôt accumulate outdated files.

  #### Key Features:
  - **`startCleaning()`**: Starts the cleaning process by running in a loop, checking and removing files that are older than the defined age limit.
  - **`cleanOldFiles()`**: Scans specified directories and removes files that exceed the specified age threshold.

## üõ† Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites:

1. **Install ImDisk**:  
   To use the RamDisk functionality, you need to install [ImDisk](https://www.ltr-data.se/opencode.html/#ImDisk). Once installed, create a disk (e.g., `F:`) which will be used to store the processed images between processes.

2. **OpenCV with CUDA**:  
   For optimal inference time, **OpenCV** should be installed with **CUDA support**. You can follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8Jx6zO1yw0) to set up OpenCV with CUDA.

3. **CMake**:  
   You'll also need **CMake** installed for building the project.

4. **C++ Compiler**:  
   Ensure that you have a compatible C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang).

Here‚Äôs the corrected version of your steps:

### Steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/davidbv01/VigiScan.git
   cd VigiScan
   ```

2. **Build the project:**

   1. **Create a build directory:**
      ```bash
      mkdir build
      cd build
      ```

   2. **Run CMake to generate the Makefile:**
      ```bash
      cmake ..
      ```

   3. **Build the project:**
      ```bash
      make
      ```

3. **Set up the environment:**

   Make sure the YOLO model file (`best.onnx`) and the `databest.yaml` are correctly set up and located in the project directory.

4. **Run the application:**

   Use the compiled executable to start processing images or cleaning old files:
   ```bash
   ./imageProcessor
   ``` 

## üéØ Key Features

- **Real-time Object Detection:** The YOLO model detects objects in real-time and provides bounding boxes for identified objects in images.
  
- **File Cleaning:** The RamDisk Cleaner module runs in the background, automatically deleting files that have surpassed the defined age limit, ensuring efficient storage usage.
  
- **Customizable:** Both modules are highly configurable, allowing you to change parameters like object detection thresholds and the age limit for file cleaning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### YOLO Object Detection
- **Confidence Threshold:** Controls the minimum confidence level for detected objects. Objects below this threshold will be ignored.
  
- **IOU Threshold:** Used for non-maximum suppression to avoid multiple bounding boxes for the same object.
  
- **Image Size:** Defines the input image resolution for the YOLO model.

### RamDisk Cleaner
- **Age Limit:** Sets the maximum age of files (in seconds) before they are deleted.
